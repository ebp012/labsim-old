			<title>LabSim 2.0.2 released</title>
			<link>https://labsim.ebp11.repl.co</link>
			<description>After the redesign and sidebar in LabSim 2.0, we've <i>finally</i> added another feature: tabbing and windowing support. The window switcher is available for free as a sidebar gadget, and does not require installation due to it being auto-installed for you. For those who wish not to use such gadget, it may be removed by pressing the gears to get to Personalisation, and then hiding the gadget "Window Switcher". Although still in progress, at this time you may access the default sandbox as well as the freshly updated Demonstrations page. The Aeonic Corporation hopes you enjoy this new feature.</description>
