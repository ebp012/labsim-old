# LabSim
LabSim is a virtual laboratory software. Conduct experiments and play with dangerous elements. All without risking your life or getting a physical laboratory. An educational game where you can learn for class but also do for fun. Oddly satisfying!<br/>
Play for absolutely free at https://labsim.ebp11.repl.co/ .
I am still trying to add the code from Repl.it to github. The repl's link is https://repl.it/@ebp11/labsim .
### Credits
LabSim was originally made as a collection of existing Sandboxels mod called Proboxels. Later, a mod named Turtleguineapigs was fully merged into Proboxels. The creators of Turtleguineapigs joined Aeonic, then known as E11. They came up with the name LabSim, and designed the original logo.
The creators of LabSim shall give credit to R74n, the original creator of Sandboxels. LabSim is a fork of Sandboxels version 1.4.
